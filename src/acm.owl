	<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This ontology was derived from a SKOS vocabulary using the SKOS2OWL online tool.
The GenTax algorithm was developed by Martin Hepp and Jos de Bruijn. The SKOS2OWL tool was developed by Martin Hepp and Andreas Radinger.
For more information see http://www.heppnetz.de/skos2owl/
The GenTax algorithm is explained in the following publication:
Martin Hepp, Jos de Bruijn: GenTax: A Generic Methodology for Deriving OWL and RDF-S Ontologies from Hierarchical Classifications, Thesauri, and Inconsistent Taxonomies, Proceedings of the 4th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2007), June 3-7, Innsbruck, Austria, in: E. Fraconi, M. Kifer, and W. May (Eds.): ESWC 2007, LNCS 4519,  Springer 2007, pp.129-144.
